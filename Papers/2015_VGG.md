#  Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition

[ICLR 2015 Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)

## Summary
Investigate the effect of CNN depth on accuray in large-scale image recognition setting.

## Introduction
ConvNets have recently enjoyed a great success in large-scale image and video recognition.  
A number of attempts to improve orginial ConvNet:
* smaller receptive window size and smaller stride of the first conv layer.  
* training and testing the networks densely over the whole image and over multiple scales.  
* **this paper**: adding more conv layers(3x3 filters)
