[CVPR 2015 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf)

## Summary
* utilized computing resources inside the network:  
increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational cost constant.  
* Hebbian principle
* multi-scale processing
* approximating the expected optimal sparse structure by readily available dense building blocks is a viable method for improving neural networks for computer vision.  
**Moving to sparser architectures is feasible and useful idea in general.**
