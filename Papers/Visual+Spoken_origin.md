# Unsupervised Learning of Spoken Language with Visual Context

[paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6186-unsupervised-learning-of-spoken-language-with-visual-context.pdf)

## Summary
* contextually relevant visual images + untranscribed audio training data -> spoken language acquisition.  

## Introduction
### Problem Statement
Convential ASRs rely on supervision(expensive!).  
Spectrum:  
* high supervision -> easy ml algorithm + heavy human annotations.  
* less annotation -> difficult ml algorithm + flexibility.  
  
->**Sensor-based learning**:acquire language by observation and interaction.
