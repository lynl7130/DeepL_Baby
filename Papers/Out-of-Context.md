## Summary
1. presented a new scene understanding problem:  
finding scenes and objects that are "out-of-context".  
2. evaluated different sources of context information, and presented a graphical model that combines these sources.  
* global contextual information
* object co-occurrence statistics
* geometric context
3. showed that physical support relationships between objects can provide useful contextual information for both object recognition and out-of-context detection.
