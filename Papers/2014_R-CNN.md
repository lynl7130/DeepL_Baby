# Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation

[CVPR 2014 Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524.pdf)

## Summary
### MAP
[Tutorial](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/map-mean-average-precision-for-object-detection-45c121a31173)  
* MAP is the mean across classes of APs(binary), sometimes is also called AP.  

### R-CNN:Regions with CNN features
#### Two key insights:  
1. apply high-capacity CNNs to bottom-up region proposals: localize and segment objects
2. when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task(**image classification**) + domain-specific fine-tuning(**detection**), yields a significant performance boost
#### combing
* computer vision: classification tools
* deep learning: bottom-up region proposals and CNNs
