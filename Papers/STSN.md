# Object Detection in Video with Spatiotemporal Sampling Networks

[ECCV 2018 Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05549.pdf)

## Summary
STSN(Spatiotemporal Sampling Network):  
* learing to spatially sample features from adjacent frames
* optimizes sampling locations directly with respect to object detection performance
* best perform on ImageNet VID
* does not require optical flow data for training(prior work)
* better than state-of-art FGFA!
