## Introduction
Key element: interact with the environment and learn from those interactions.  
learning from still images/videos -> human-like learning.  

### What's in AI2-THOR?
120 scenes spanning four different categories: kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom.  
  
### AI2-THOR's features:  
1. actionable objects.  
2. near photo-realistic.  
3. no bias(designed by 3D artists!)  
4. a Python API to interact with Unity3D engine: navigation, applying force, object interaction and physics modeling.  
  
### Why AI2-THOR?
a scalable, fast and cheap proxy for real world experiments in different types of scenarios.
