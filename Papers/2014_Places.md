# Learning Deep Features for Scene Recognition using Places Database
[NIPS 2014 Paper](http://places.csail.mit.edu/places_NIPS14.pdf)

## Summary
* Places: a scene-centric database(while ImageNet: a database for object recognition)
* proposed new methods to compare the density and diversity and Places is better
* proved better scene recognition task performance using Places
* showed differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks.  

## Introduction
### Why not ImageNet?
Information by iconic images of objects < Information by scenes and environments
### Other database are too small:
* Scene15:
The first benchmark for scene classification!
- few categories, few images per class
- being saturated
* MIT Indoor67
- 67 categories on indoor places
* SUN database
- introduced to provide a wide coverage of scene categories: 397 categories
- more than 100 images per category
* SUN Attribute Database

## Places Database
>7,000,000 images from 476 place categories. ~ ImageNet  

### Building the Places Dataset
